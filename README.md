# Predicting Customer Purchase Likelihood

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict the likelihood of a customer making a purchase on an e-commerce website using supervised machine learning techniques. The dataset used contains various features related to user behavior, session information, and other relevant metrics.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project includes the following features:

1. **Administrative**: Number of administrative pages visited during the session. Administrative pages typically involve account management, login, or customer support. (Integer, 0 to 27)

2. **Administrative Duration**: Total time spent on administrative pages during the session, measured in seconds. (Float, 0.0 to 3398.75)

3. **Informational**: Number of informational pages visited during the session. Informational pages provide content about the website, such as FAQs, company information, or blog articles. (Integer, 0 to 24)

4. **Informational Duration**: Total time spent on informational pages during the session, measured in seconds. (Float, 0.0 to 2549.375)

5. **Product Related**: Number of product-related pages visited during the session. Product-related pages include product listings, product detail pages, and any other pages that showcase items for sale. (Integer, 0 to 705)

6. **ProductRelated Duration**: Total time spent on product-related pages during the session, measured in seconds. (Float, 0.0 to 63973.52223)

7. **BounceRates**: Bounce rate is the percentage of visitors who enter the site and then leave without continuing to view other pages. For example, if a visitor lands on a page and leaves the site without clicking on any other links, that session is considered a bounce. (Float, 0.0 to 0.2)

8. **ExitRates**: The exit rate is the percentage of times a page was the last one viewed in a session. It is calculated by dividing the number of exits from a page by the total number of pageviews for that page. For example, if a page has 100 views and 20 of those views end the session, the exit rate for that page is 20%. (Float, 0.0 to 0.2)

9. **PageValues**: The page value represents the average value of a web page that a user visited before completing an e-commerce transaction. It is calculated by dividing the total revenue generated by the number of unique pageviews for each page. This metric helps to identify which pages contribute most to revenue generation. (Float, 0.0 to 361.763742)

10. **SpecialDay**: This feature indicates the closeness of the visit to a special day. The value ranges from 0 to 1, where 1 represents the closest day to a special event like Mother's Day or Valentine's Day. The value is higher as the visit gets closer to the special day. For instance, the value for Valentine's Day might be 1 on February 8th and decrease as the date moves away from the special day. (Float, 0.0 to 1.0)

11. **Month**: The month of the year when the session occurred, encoded as integers from 0 to 9, corresponding to months from January to October. (Encoded as integers 0 to 9)

12. **OperatingSystems**:
   - 1: Windows
   - 2: Macintosh
   - 3: Linux
   - 4: iOS
   - 5: Android
   - 6: Other (e.g., Unix)
   - 7: Windows Phone
   - 8: Chrome OS

13. **Browser**:
   - 1: Chrome
   - 2: Firefox
   - 3: Internet Explorer
   - 4: Safari
   - 5: Edge
   - 6: Opera
   - 7: Android Browser
   - 8: Blackberry Browser
   - 9: UC Browser
   - 10: Silk
   - 11: WebOS Browser
   - 12: Unknown
   - 13: Other

14. **Region**:
   - 1: North America
   - 2: Europe
   - 3: Asia
   - 4: South America
   - 5: Australia
   - 6: Africa
   - 7: Antarctica
   - 8: Middle East
   - 9: Central America

15. **TrafficType**:
   - 1: Direct Traffic
   - 2: Referral
   - 3: Organic Search
   - 4: Paid Search
   - 5: Email
   - 6: Affiliates
   - 7: Social
   - 8: Display
   - 9: Other (e.g., Campaign)
   - 10-20: Custom traffic sources defined by the website owner or analytics provider

16. **VisitorType**: Type of visitor (0 = New Visitor, 1 = Returning Visitor, 2 = Other). (Encoded as integers 0 to 2)

17. **Weekend**: Indicator for visits on the weekend. (Boolean, 0 = No, 1 = Yes)

## Key Takeaways

1. **Page values**: This feature has the highest impact on the model's output. A higher page value (calculated by dividing the total revenue generated by the number of unique pageviews for each page) significantly increases the likelihood of purchase. The optimal page value for predicting a purchase is **29.233433696969694**.

2. **Visitor type**: Returning visitors are more likely to make a purchase compared to new visitors.

3. **Month**: The month in which the user visits the site impacts the likelihood of purchase, with certain months showing higher purchasing activity due to seasonal trends or holidays. The optimal month for predicting a purchase is **2** (February), likely reflecting increased shopping activity around Valentine’s Day.

4. **Administrative pages**: The number of administrative pages visited has a moderate impact on the prediction, indicating user engagement or thoroughness in navigation before purchasing. The optimal value for administrative pages is **0**, and the optimal value for administrative duration is **0.0**. This suggests that less time spent on administrative tasks correlates with a higher likelihood of purchase.

5. **Exit rates and bounce rates**: Both features negatively affect purchase likelihood, as higher exit and bounce rates are associated with a lower likelihood of purchase. The optimal value for bounce rates is **≈0.002**, and for exit rates, it is **≈0.004**. This indicates that minimal bouncing and exiting behaviors are associated with higher purchase probabilities.

6. **Operating systems**: The operating system used by the visitor also influences purchase likelihood, with certain operating systems being more user-friendly or prevalent among purchasing customers. The optimal value for operating systems is **1** (Windows), suggesting that users on Windows platforms are more likely to make purchases.
